# hello-world
Just another repository.
I am a self taught programmer starting to work on an actual application for running some equipment at my job.  I am supposed to be collaborating with a team, so I am trying to figure out GitHub as a way of working on the UI and features while other members of the team work on hardware communication.  Wish me luck.
